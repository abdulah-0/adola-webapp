## Technical Implementation

### Core Changes

#### Enhanced Crash Point Generation - UPDATED FOR REDUCED MAX OUTPUTS
```typescript
const generateHighMultiplierCrashPoint = (): number => {
  const random = Math.random();

  if (random < 0.60) return 1.0 + Math.random() * 1.5;      // 60%: 1-2.5x (INCREASED LOW RANGE)
  if (random < 0.85) return 2.5 + Math.random() * 2.5;      // 25%: 2.5-5x (REDUCED)
  if (random < 0.96) return 5.0 + Math.random() * 5.0;      // 11%: 5-10x (REDUCED)
  if (random < 0.99) return 10.0 + Math.random() * 10.0;    // 3%: 10-20x (REDUCED FROM 500x)
  return 20.0 + Math.random() * 10.0;                       // 1%: 20-30x (REDUCED FROM 1000x)
};
```

#### Advanced Game Logic Integration
