## 📄 Project Requirements Document

### 🎯 Title: Convert Expo Android App to Web App Deployable on Vercel

---

### 🧾 Objective

Convert the existing and fully functional Expo-based Android app into a web-compatible app using Expo for Web. The goal is to ensure feature parity between the mobile and web versions and deploy the web version on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) with proper optimization and responsiveness.

---

## ✅ Functional Requirements

### 1. **Web Compatibility & Feature Parity**

* The web app should maintain all core functionalities of the Android app:

  * Authentication (e.g., Firebase/Supabase/Auth0)
  * Navigation and Routing
  * API calls and data rendering
  * Game logic, wallet functionality, user dashboards, etc.
* All buttons, forms, and interactive components must function as they do on Android.

### 2. **Responsive Layout**

* Components should adjust for different screen sizes:

  * Desktop (≥1024px)
  * Tablet (768px–1024px)
  * Mobile (<768px)
* Use `react-native-web`, `@expo/vector-icons`, and `react-native-responsive-screen` or `react-native-responsive-dimensions` for responsiveness.

### 3. **Web Assets**

* Add `favicon`, `meta tags`, `manifest.json`, and SEO basics to enhance browser presence.
* Add web-specific icons and splash screens.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements

### 1. **Update Project Configuration**

* Update `app.json` or `app.config.js` with the following web-specific fields:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "MyApp",
    "platforms": ["ios", "android", "web"],
    "web": {
      "favicon": "./assets/favicon.png"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. **Navigation**

* Ensure navigation uses `react-navigation` with `@react-navigation/native-stack` or `@react-navigation/web`.
* Wrap navigation in `NavigationContainer` with `linking` config for URL support.

### 3. **Conditional Imports (if needed)**

* Use `Platform.OS` to conditionally render platform-specific components if something only works on mobile.

```js
import { Platform } from 'react-native';

if (Platform.OS === 'web') {
  // Web-specific logic
}
```

### 4. **Expo Web Build**

* Run `npx expo start --web` to test locally.
* Fix any warnings or compatibility issues.

---

## 🚀 Deployment to Vercel

### 1. **Install Vercel CLI (optional)**

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

### 2. **Prepare for Deployment**

* Run:

```bash
npx expo export:web
```

* This will generate a `web-build/` directory containing static HTML, CSS, JS.

### 3. **Deploy to Vercel**

* Go to [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and log in.
* Create a new project and connect it to your GitHub repo (if using Git).
* Select the root directory of your project.
* In "Framework Preset", choose **Other**.
* Set the **Build Command**:

  ```bash
  expo export:web
  ```
* Set **Output Directory**:

  ```bash
  web-build
  ```

Alternatively, using CLI:

```bash
vercel --prod --prebuilt
```

### 4. **Custom Domain (optional)**

* Set up a custom domain via the Vercel dashboard or use the default `your-app.vercel.app`.

---

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### 1. **Cross-Platform Testing**

* Test core features in:

  * Chrome, Firefox, Safari (Web)
  * Android Emulator (to verify no regressions)

### 2. **Responsiveness Testing**

* Manually test using browser dev tools at multiple resolutions.
* Use tools like [responsively.app](https://responsively.app/) for multi-device previews.

---

## ⚙️ Optimization Checklist

* [ ] Use `expo-optimize` to compress assets
* [ ] Lazy-load heavy components (e.g., games)
* [ ] Use smaller fonts and buttons for desktop (optional tweaks)
* [ ] Tree-shake unused libraries if any

---

## 📦 Optional Enhancements

* Add PWA support by adding `manifest.json` and enabling service workers.
* Integrate analytics (Google Analytics, Plausible, etc.)
* Add user support features (chat widget, FAQs)

---

## 📚 Dependencies to Review

Ensure the following dependencies are installed and compatible with web:

* `react-native-web`
* `react-dom`
* `react-native-gesture-handler`
* `expo install react-native-web react-dom`

---

## 📌 Notes & Warnings

* Avoid native-only modules unless they have web support.
* File system, camera, and Bluetooth may need platform-specific handling.
* You may have to stub certain modules for web using `react-native-web`'s `aliases` feature.
