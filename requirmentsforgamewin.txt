**Player Engagement & House Edge Mechanism for Online Betting App**

---

## 1. **Objective**

Design a dynamic reward and probability system that:

* Keeps users engaged by offering occasional wins.
* Ensures that the house (app owner) consistently profits over time.
* Adapts win probabilities and payouts based on player behavior and history.
* Is scalable and configurable per game type (e.g., Plinko, Ocho, Aviator).

---

## 2. **Key Features**

* **Dynamic Win Probability Adjustment**
* **Adaptive Payout Calculation**
* **User Behavior Tracking**
* **Configurable House Edge**
* **Fairness Control**
* **Engagement Incentives (Loss Recovery, Win Streaks, Bonuses)**

---

## 3. **Functional Requirements**

### 3.1 Win Calculation Engine

#### Input:

* `B` â†’ Bet Amount
* `P` â†’ Base Payout Multiplier (based on game mechanics)
* `T` â†’ Total Games Played by User
* `W_total` â†’ Total Amount the User has Won
* `L_total` â†’ Total Amount the User has Lost
* `H` â†’ House Edge (configured per game, e.g., 3%â€“10%)

#### Output:

* Final win/loss result
* Adjusted payout (if any)

#### Logic:

```text
If random() < base_win_probability(T, W_total, L_total):
    payout = B Ã— P Ã— payout_modulator(H, T, W_total, L_total)
Else:
    payout = 0
```

---

### 3.2 Base Win Probability Function

```python
base_win_probability = 0.15 + f(T, W_total, L_total)  # UPDATED: Reduced from 0.45 to 0.15 for higher house wins
```

#### Where:

* If `W_total > L_total`, reduce the base win probability by 8â€“15% (increased reduction).
* If `L_total > W_total`, temporarily increase win probability to improve retention (but capped at lower maximum).

---

### 3.3 Payout Modulator Function

```python
payout_modulator = 1 - H - (W_total - L_total) / (T Ã— B Ã— 10)
```

This reduces payout slightly for profitable players and keeps it higher for those losing, while maintaining overall profit.

---

### 3.4 House Edge Configuration

* Should be **globally configurable** per game type.
* Range recommendation: `0.03` (3%) to `0.10` (10%)
* Stored and fetched from database or admin dashboard.

---

## 4. **Non-Functional Requirements**

### 4.1 Fairness & Randomness

* Use cryptographic random number generation (e.g., `crypto.randomUUID()` or `secureRandom()`).
* Optionally implement **provably fair logic** using server-client seed hashes.

### 4.2 Performance

* Engine must compute results in <50ms per round for smooth real-time feedback.
* Cache commonly used user metrics (T, W\_total, L\_total) for speed.

### 4.3 Security

* Securely store and audit all gameplay results.
* Prevent API tampering or direct payouts without backend logic.

---

## 5. **User Engagement Features**

### 5.1 Win Streak Boost

* If player wins 2â€“3 times in a row, show visual excitement (animations, sounds).
* Slightly reduce next win chance to balance.

### 5.2 Loss Recovery Bonus

* After 5+ losses, temporarily increase `base_win_probability` by 5â€“15%.
* Cap recovery bonus to a certain amount per day.

### 5.3 Visual Psychology Triggers

* Use **near-miss animations** (e.g., ball drops next to big prize).
* Time-based streaks: daily rewards, spin-the-wheel after every 10 games.

---

## 6. **Admin Dashboard Controls**

* Adjust house edge (`H`) per game.
* Toggle behavior incentives (e.g., Loss Recovery Mode ON/OFF).
* View analytics: most profitable players, average payout, player churn.

---

## 7. **Data Logging & Analytics**

For each player:

* Track: `T`, `W_total`, `L_total`, average payout, net balance.
* Store win/loss history for backend audit and responsible gambling analysis.
* Optional: track psychological metrics like time of day most played, duration per session.

---

## 8. **Legal & Ethical Compliance**

* Display win probabilities clearly in Terms or on UI (e.g., "Average RTP: 95%").
* Comply with local gambling and data protection laws.
* Offer responsible gambling tools (cool-down timers, self-exclusion, withdrawal limits).

---

## 9. **Implementation Recommendations**

* Backend: Node.js, Python, or Go for logic execution.
* Use Redis or in-memory store for active player stats.
* Ensure results are calculated on the **backend only** (not on frontend).
* Consider blockchain-based fairness validation for advanced use cases.

---

## 10. **Success Metrics**

* Average session duration â†‘
* Daily retention â†‘
* House profitability over time â†‘
* Payout-to-bet ratio maintained under 0.85 (reduced from 0.95 for higher house profits)
* Repeat player rate â†‘
